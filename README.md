# WineClassifier
This is a school project I worked on in the Fall 2018 semester that utilized n-gram tokens in approximately paragraph long reviews to identify the type of wine. The main model I presented was the 8-class classifier using the artificial neural network in R but later research demonstrated the potential for an improved model using one-versus-all (OVA) classification. You can see that progress towards the end of my code where I explored class accuracy for a few of the wines.
